# Online multi-cluster workload dispatch

`mpi_performance_dispatch` models one dispatcher and multiple cluster systems,
with one independent DR_EVT simulation per system. For each arriving workload,
the dispatcher selects a compatible system using the workload's predicted
relative performance and the systems' current simulated queue states.
Ground-truth relative performance determines how long the workload actually
runs on the selected system. Dispatch is online so that each decision accounts
for the latest estimated queue wait; the policy minimizes predicted turnaround,
which combines that wait with predicted run time.

The native implementation uses MPI, with Ser20 serialization for message
packing; it does not require gRPC or Python. Rank 0 owns the input tables,
random-number generator, and dispatch policy. Each other rank owns one
`Simulation`, and worker-rank order matches systems-table row order. The
corresponding Python implementation uses gRPC for dispatcher-worker
communication, while MPI starts the worker processes that host the gRPC
servers.

## Script guide

The scripts stay in one directory because the campaign tools import shared
helpers from one another. They are grouped by purpose here so the intended
workflow is explicit:

| Stage | Script | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Prepare | `build_performance_tables.py` | Join model predictions to measurements and create normalized ground-truth/prediction tables. |
| Prepare | `build_prediction_baselines.py` | Create full-data application-average and system-benchmark baselines. |
| Prepare | `build_app_average_from_training.py` | Create an application-average baseline from a long-form training subset. |
| Inspect | `plot_relative_performance.py` | Compare one prediction table with ground truth by execution mode. |
| Run | `mpi_performance_dispatch.cpp` | Native MPI online dispatcher; installed as `mpi_performance_dispatch`. |
| Run | `grpc_performance_dispatch.py` | Equivalent Python controller for independent gRPC simulation servers. |
| Campaign | `run_prediction_study.py` | Run the standard ideal/application-average/RAJAPerf matrix. |
| Campaign | `run_kt_scheduling_study.py` | Prepare and run the knowledge-transfer matrix, with resumable completion markers. |
| Analyze | `analyze_kt_scheduling_campaign.py` | Validate a KT campaign, replay recorded placements, and report wait/placement results. |
| Compare | `plot_trace_scale_comparison.py` | Compare caller-selected trace-scale campaigns in publication plots. |

Every command supports `--help`. The sections below define the common input
model first, then document the run and campaign workflows.

## Input model

The experiment has five CSV inputs. Column names are case-sensitive.

### Job stream

```text
submit_time,num_nodes,time_limit,duration
0,2,14400,3618
0,1,43200,42015
1,4,7200,252
```

| Column | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `submit_time` | Arrival time in simulation seconds. Rows must be in nondecreasing order. The legacy alias `job_submit_time` is accepted. |
| `num_nodes` | Positive node request. |
| `time_limit` | Positive whole-number wall-time limit in seconds; fractional values are rejected. |
| `duration` | Positive reference duration, no greater than `time_limit`. The legacy alias `actual_run_time` is accepted. |

`job_id` is optional and defaults to the zero-based row number. The queue is
also optional and defaults to Queue1; use `q_id` normally or `queue` with
`DR_EVT_LEGACY_QUEUE_INPUT=ON`.

### Application requirements

```text
#app,sys_requirement
amg,CPU-only
xsbench,GPU-portable
laghos,GPU-portable
minife.x,GPU-portable
minivite,CPU-only
testdfft,CPU-only
```

The accepted values are `CPU-only`, `GPU-only`, and `GPU-portable`. Every
application in the performance tables must occur exactly once. The requirement is
application-specific, not job-stream-specific. `experimental/multi-cluster/apps.csv` is a
runtime input; the `#` prefix on its first header is accepted.

### Systems

```text
#machine,size,GPU
dane,514,CPU-only
mammoth,64,CPU-only
tioga,30,GPU-enabled
tuolumne,384,GPU-enabled
matrix,26,GPU-enabled
```

`experimental/multi-cluster/machines.csv` is a runtime input. Its columns are machine name,
physical node count, and machine type (`CPU-only` or `GPU-enabled`); the `#`
prefix on the first header is accepted. The size is the worker simulation's
schedulable capacity. Because background jobs are not modeled, this represents
an otherwise idle machine and therefore overstates real-world availability.

A job is considered for every compatible machine whose configured size can
host it. With the table above, requests of 27 through 30 nodes can also run on
Tioga, and requests through 64 nodes can run on Mammoth. Only requests of 65
through 384 nodes are limited by capacity to Dane and Tuolumne, while larger
requests can run only on Dane. A request
larger than the largest configured machine is truncated to that largest size
so it remains runnable. The dispatcher writes a warning to standard error for
each truncated request. Both the original and effective node counts are
recorded in the decision output.

Performance-column names are inferred from the machine rows. A CPU-only
machine named `dane` uses `dane`. A GPU-enabled machine named `matrix` uses
`matrix-cpu` and `matrix-gpu`.

### Ground-truth and prediction tables

Ground truth and predictions are separate, caller-selected CSV inputs. Both
contain the same workload identities and execution-mode columns:

```text
App,Args,Ranks,dane,mammoth,matrix-cpu,matrix-gpu,tioga-cpu,tioga-gpu,tuolumne-cpu,tuolumne-gpu
amg,-problem1-p442-n12812864,32,0.9821,1.0446,1.0943,,1.2496,,2.2508,
```

`--ground-truth` supplies measured speedups and `--prediction` supplies values
available to the dispatch policy. Values are positive, dimensionless speedups
relative to the job stream's `duration`: a speedup of `2.0` means half that
duration. The two files must have identical `(App, Args, Ranks)` identities,
but their missing-value patterns may differ. A mode is dispatchable only when
both its ground-truth and prediction cells are present. They need no named
Quartz column, but must use the same duration reference.

Rows without a usable measurement for any configured compatible system are
reported and omitted. Duplicate `(app, args, ranks)` rows are rejected.
Applications absent from the application-to-requirement table are omitted,
allowing that table to act as an application sampling allowlist.

Generate the production table by joining the prediction matrix to measured
target runtimes:

The first four options identify existing input files:

- `--predictions`: input model-prediction matrix
- `--measurements`: input measured-runtime data
- `--applications`: input application compatibility/allowlist table
- `--systems`: input system configuration table

The final two options identify files created by the command:

- `--ground-truth-output`: output CSV of normalized measured performance
- `--prediction-output`: output CSV of normalized predicted performance

In particular, `--predictions` is an input, while `--prediction-output` is an
output.

#### Prediction-matrix input format

`--predictions` expects a CSV with the identity columns `app`, `args`, and
`ranks`, followed by performance columns. It must contain a performance column
for every mode derived from `--systems`: a CPU-only machine produces a
`<machine>` column, while a GPU-enabled machine produces `<machine>-cpu` and
`<machine>-gpu` columns. Additional columns, such as a non-dispatch reference
machine, are allowed.

```text
app,args,ranks,borax,dane,matrix-cpu,matrix-gpu,tioga-cpu,tioga-gpu,tuolumne-cpu,tuolumne-gpu,mammoth
amg,-problem1-p442-n12812864,32,0.9738,0.9821,1.0943,,1.2496,,2.2508,,1.0446
```

`ranks` must be an integer. Every populated performance cell must be a finite,
positive number; an empty cell means that no prediction is available. Quote an
`args` field using normal CSV quoting when it contains a comma.

#### Measurement input format

`--measurements` expects a CSV with the columns `machine`, `rank`, `app`,
`args`, and `actual_run_time`. Additional columns are ignored. The first header
may optionally begin with `#`, so both `machine` and `#machine` are accepted.

```text
#machine,rank,app,args,actual_run_time
borax,32,amg,"-problem 1 -P 4 4 2 -n 128 128 64",27.971479
```

`rank` must be an integer, and `actual_run_time` must be a finite, positive
number. For a GPU-enabled system, an unsuffixed measurement-machine name such
as `matrix` supplies the `matrix-gpu` mode, while `matrix-cpu` supplies the CPU
mode. Measurement machines that are neither a performance column in the
prediction matrix nor a mode mapped from `--systems` are ignored.

The two inputs are joined on `(app, args, ranks)`. Application names are
matched case-insensitively, and argument strings are matched after removing
whitespace and ignoring case; the measurement column is named `rank`, whereas
the prediction-matrix column is named `ranks`.

```bash
source docs/venv/bin/activate
python3 experimental/multi-cluster/build_performance_tables.py \
  --predictions /data/model_predictions.csv \
  --measurements /data/measured_runtimes.csv \
  --applications experimental/multi-cluster/apps.csv \
  --systems experimental/multi-cluster/machines.csv \
  --ground-truth-output experimental/multi-cluster/ground_truth.csv \
  --prediction-output experimental/multi-cluster/prediction.csv
```

The join key is `(app, args, ranks)` after lowercasing the application and
removing whitespace and case differences from `args`; commas inside quoted
argument fields remain part of the argument. Ground truth retains every
compatible target-mode measurement and normalizes it to the first measured
non-dispatch reference in table order (normally Borax), falling back to a
compatible target mode only when needed. Model predictions are emitted only
when they can use that same reference, so missing model coverage never removes
ground-truth measurements. Quartz data is not required. In `merged.txt`, the
unsuffixed `matrix`, `tioga`, and `tuolumne` measurements represent their GPU
modes; their `-cpu` rows represent CPU modes.

Generate two interchangeable prediction baselines:

```bash
source docs/venv/bin/activate
python3 experimental/multi-cluster/build_prediction_baselines.py \
  --ground-truth experimental/multi-cluster/ground_truth.csv \
  --machine-rep /data/machine_rep.csv \
  --rajaperf-output experimental/multi-cluster/prediction.rajaperf.csv \
  --app-avg-output experimental/multi-cluster/prediction.app_avg.csv
```

The RAJAPerf baseline computes `borax_time / machine_time` for every shared
kernel position, averages those ratios per execution mode, and assigns that
machine-level value to every workload and system mode. Repeated kernel names
remain distinct positional samples. The application-average baseline assigns
the arithmetic mean ground-truth speedup for each `(App, Ranks, execution
mode)` group and retains the workload's measured-mode coverage.

#### Optional plotting

Plot actual (x-axis) against predicted (y-axis) relative performance for every
configured machine/execution-mode column (for example, `dane`, `mammoth`,
`matrix-cpu`, or `matrix-gpu`), with a consistent color for each application.
Here, execution mode identifies the CPU or GPU implementation on a machine; it
does not refer to the simulator's `run_time_mode` option:

```bash
source docs/venv/bin/activate
python3 experimental/multi-cluster/plot_relative_performance.py \
  --ground-truth experimental/multi-cluster/ground_truth.csv \
  --prediction experimental/multi-cluster/prediction.csv \
  --output experimental/multi-cluster/relative-performance.png
```

The default logarithmic axes make both sub-unit and large speedups visible.
Use `--linear` for linear axes or `--systems tuolumne tuolumne-cpu dane` to
select panels. Unsuffixed GPU-machine names resolve to their `-gpu` columns.
Cells lacking either an actual or predicted value are reported and omitted
because they cannot form an actual-versus-predicted point. When `--output`
does not already name a PDF, the plotter also writes a PDF with the same stem.

## Sampling

For every arriving job, rank 0:

1. Selects one application uniformly from applications with usable workloads.
2. Selects one workload uniformly from that application's usable `(app, args,
   ranks)` rows.

Applications therefore have equal probability even when their sample counts
differ. `--seed` controls the controller RNG and defaults to `0`, making runs
reproducible. Sampling is controller state; it adds no workload-catalog
bookkeeping to the DR_EVT simulations.

## Compatibility and execution mode

| Requirement | CPU-only system | GPU-enabled system |
|---|---|---|
| `CPU-only` | CPU measurement | CPU measurement |
| `GPU-only` | Incompatible | GPU measurement |
| `GPU-portable` | CPU measurement | Faster predicted CPU or GPU measurement |

A missing ground-truth value makes that mode unavailable. A missing prediction
excludes the mode from normal prediction-based placement, but ground truth is
retained so the mode can be used by the wait-time fallback described below. A
machine is also excluded when its configured size is smaller than the job's
effective node request.

## Online dispatch

At each arrival, the controller samples a workload, advances every worker to
the submission time, and queries current free nodes, release schedule,
EASY-backfill shadow time, and prediction horizon. For each compatible system:

```text
estimated_duration   = duration   / predicted_relative_performance
actual_duration      = duration   / ground_truth_relative_performance
predicted_time_limit = time_limit      / predicted_relative_performance
actual_time_limit    = time_limit      / ground_truth_relative_performance
predicted_turnaround = estimated_wait  + estimated_duration
```

The experiment assumes that the submitting user can correct an underestimated
wall-time request using the known ground-truth runtime before the successful
submission. Starting from `predicted_time_limit`, it doubles the request until
it is at least `actual_duration`, without simulating or charging resources for
the failed attempts. `--max-time-limit` caps the adapted request; the
prediction study defaults to Lassen's 43,200-second maximum. If
`actual_duration` exceeds that maximum, the experiment writes a `dropped:`
record to standard error and does not submit the job. Dropped jobs are excluded
from simulation statistics. This intentionally optimistic assumption isolates
placement quality from the cost of discovering a sufficient wall-time limit.

During prediction-based placement, candidate systems whose predicted or
ground-truth runtime exceeds `--max-time-limit` are discarded regardless of
their waiting time. If a prediction exists but no candidate passes these
checks, the job is dropped. When no prediction is available at all, the
fallback below requires only a ground-truth runtime within the maximum.

`--dispatch-policy` selects one of three placement rules:

- `turnaround` chooses the smallest predicted turnaround, breaking ties by
  estimated wait and then systems-table order.
- `RelPerfOnly` implements Algorithm 2 from D. Nichols et al., "Predicting
  Cross-Architecture Performance of Parallel Programs," IEEE IPDPS'24. It
  chooses the highest predicted relative performance among feasible systems
  with enough nodes available immediately. If every feasible system is full,
  it chooses the highest predicted relative performance over all feasible
  systems and lets that system queue the job. Ties use systems-table order.
- `WaitTimeOnly` ignores the prediction table's relative-performance values and
  chooses the feasible system with the smallest estimated wait, breaking ties
  by systems-table order. GPU-portable workloads use a feasible GPU mode when
  available. Ground truth is still used to determine feasibility and the
  realized runtime, but not to rank candidate systems.

For `turnaround` and `RelPerfOnly`, if no capacity-compatible,
ground-truth-feasible execution mode has a prediction for the arriving
workload, dispatch falls back to `WaitTimeOnly` for that job. A neutral
predicted speedup of 1.0 is used to calculate its submitted limit, and the
decision is marked by `prediction_fallback=true`. The fallback is not used
when any otherwise feasible prediction exists, even if that prediction is
later rejected by the predicted-runtime limit.

`--wall-time-policy adapted-limit` uses the doubling behavior described
above. `--wall-time-policy actual-duration` instead submits the smallest
whole-second time limit that covers the selected system's ground-truth runtime.
This second policy never changes or truncates the runtime; it changes only the
requested time limit.

The wait estimate uses the submitted time limit. Only the selected worker
receives the job, with that limit and the actual duration. Thus prediction
error affects placement, while the resulting queue state reflects the
workload's realized performance. The next arrival observes all earlier
decisions, so dispatch remains online even though inputs are validated before
the run.

## Build and run

```bash
cmake -S . -B build -DDR_EVT_WITH_SER20=ON
cmake --build build --target mpi_performance_dispatch-bin

mpirun -np 6 build/mpi_performance_dispatch \
  --jobs multi-cluster/job_stream.csv \
  --ground-truth experimental/multi-cluster/ground_truth.csv \
  --prediction experimental/multi-cluster/prediction.csv \
  --applications experimental/multi-cluster/apps.csv \
  --systems experimental/multi-cluster/machines.csv \
  --seed 7 \
  --max-time-limit 43200 \
  --dispatch-policy RelPerfOnly \
  --wall-time-policy adapted-limit \
  --output dispatch-decisions.csv
```

Use `srun -n 6` instead of `mpirun -np 6` inside an appropriate Slurm
allocation. MPI and Ser20 are required; gRPC and Python are not.

### Prediction-study matrix

The prediction-study runner executes both dispatch policies (`turnaround` and
`RelPerfOnly`) with both wall-time policies (`adapted-limit` and
`actual-duration`) for the ideal, application-average, and RAJAPerf prediction
tables. Each of these 12 configurations runs on all ten synthetic traces, for
120 runs by default:

```bash
python experimental/multi-cluster/run_prediction_study.py \
  --executable "${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/bin/mpi_performance_dispatch" \
  --systems experimental/multi-cluster/machines.csv
```

Use `--systems` to run the whole matrix with another machine configuration,
The MPI rank count must be one dispatcher plus one rank for each machine row;
`--ranks` defaults to six.

To run the adapted-limit matrix, including the non-duplicated WaitTimeOnly
baseline, on the ten 25,000-job traces:

```bash
python experimental/multi-cluster/run_prediction_study.py \
  --executable "${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/bin/mpi_performance_dispatch" \
  --systems /data/machines-even.csv \
  --jobs-glob 'experimental/synthesize/lassen/synthetic_traces/25000/*.csv' \
  --jobs-per-trace 25000 \
  --output-dir /results/dispatch-even-25000 \
  --dispatch-policy turnaround \
  --dispatch-policy RelPerfOnly \
  --dispatch-policy WaitTimeOnly \
  --wall-time-policy adapted-limit
```

Repeat `--dispatch-policy` or `--wall-time-policy` to select a subset. For
example, the paper policy with oracle wall times is:

```bash
python experimental/multi-cluster/run_prediction_study.py \
  --executable "${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/bin/mpi_performance_dispatch" \
  --dispatch-policy RelPerfOnly \
  --wall-time-policy actual-duration
```

Output filenames and completion markers include the dispatch and wall-time
policy names. This prevents results from different configurations from being
mistaken for one another.

After all configurations are available, `summary.csv` contains one row for
each of the 120 runs, while `summary_aggregate.csv` and `summary.md` contain
the 12 ten-trace mean/standard-deviation records. `summary.png` plots those
aggregate metrics in four panels, and `summary.pdf` contains the same figure
in vector form. `metrics_per_run.csv` is retained as a compatibility copy of
`summary.csv`.

### Knowledge-transfer campaign

The knowledge-transfer workflow has four explicit stages. Keeping preparation,
execution, replay analysis, and cross-campaign plotting separate allows inputs
to be validated or figures regenerated without consuming a new MPI allocation.

#### 1. Build the five-percent application-average input

`build_app_average_from_training.py` converts long-form training data into the
wide prediction-table format used by the dispatcher:

```bash
python experimental/multi-cluster/build_app_average_from_training.py \
  --training /data/combined_train_5percent.csv \
  --ground-truth /data/ground_truth_borax.csv \
  --output /data/prediction.app_avg.5pct.csv
```

The training CSV requires the case-sensitive columns
`app,args,ranks,source_machine,target_machine,true_relative_runtime`.
`true_relative_runtime` must be positive and finite. Values are normalized to
the matching `target_machine=borax` row by default; change that name with
`--reference`. The ground-truth CSV begins with `App,Args,Ranks` followed by
execution-mode columns. The output repeats that schema and row order, leaving
a cell empty where training or ground-truth coverage is missing.

#### 2. Prepare or run the campaign

Use `--prepare-only` first to validate and normalize inputs without launching
simulations:

```bash
python experimental/multi-cluster/run_kt_scheduling_study.py \
  --ground-truth /data/ground_truth_borax.csv \
  --fully-trained /data/fully_trained.csv \
  --knowledge-transfer-1 /data/knowledge_transfer_1-percent.csv \
  --knowledge-transfer-3 /data/knowledge_transfer_3-percent.csv \
  --knowledge-transfer-5 /data/knowledge_transfer_5-percent.csv \
  --app-average-5-percent /data/prediction.app_avg.5pct.csv \
  --machine-rep /data/machine_rep.txt \
  --applications experimental/multi-cluster/apps.csv \
  --systems experimental/multi-cluster/machines.csv \
  --jobs-glob '/data/traces/synthetic_jobs_*.csv' \
  --output-dir /results/kt-scheduling \
  --prepare-only
```

The quoted glob must match exactly ten trace CSVs. Each trace contains a
header and `--jobs-per-trace` rows (100,000 by default) in the job-stream
format documented above. Prediction tables begin with `App,Args,Ranks` and
include every execution mode implied by the systems CSV. The applications CSV
requires `app,sys_requirement`; the systems CSV requires `machine,size,GPU`.
The command's `--help` text documents the model-table and system-benchmark
formats and all selectable cases.

To run the matrix, repeat the same command without `--prepare-only` and add:

```bash
--executable "${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/bin/mpi_performance_dispatch"
```

The output directory contains normalized inputs under `input_tables/`, one
`.dispatch.csv`, `.log`, and `.complete` file per run, per-run and aggregate
summary CSVs, `summary.md`, and PNG/PDF plots. A completion marker is reused
only when its fingerprint, output files, dispatch-row count, and reported job
total validate. `--aggregate-only` regenerates summaries from completed runs.
Repeat `--case`, `--dispatch-policy`, or `--wall-time-policy` to run a subset.

#### 3. Replay and analyze recorded placements

```bash
python experimental/multi-cluster/analyze_kt_scheduling_campaign.py \
  --output-dir /results/kt-scheduling \
  --systems experimental/multi-cluster/machines.csv \
  --jobs-per-trace 100000
```

The directory must contain the runner's matching `.complete`, `.log`, and
`.dispatch.csv` triplets. Analysis validates the expected ten-run groups and
replays the recorded assignments; it does not make new dispatch choices. It
writes `replay_metrics_per_run.csv`, `average_wait_by_system.csv`,
`application_execution_mode_counts.csv`, `analysis.md`, and PNG/PDF wait plots
into the campaign directory. `--plot-baseline-summary` adds a separately run
WaitTimeOnly aggregate CSV to the summary plots.

#### 4. Compare the named trace-scale campaigns

Pass each plot panel as `--campaign LABEL=CSV[,CSV]`. The CSV inputs are
`summary_aggregate.csv` files that collectively contain ten-run adapted-limit
records for Turnaround, RelPerfOnly, and WaitTimeOnly:

```bash
python experimental/multi-cluster/plot_trace_scale_comparison.py \
  --campaign 100K=/results/100k/summary_aggregate.csv,/results/100k-wait/summary_aggregate.csv \
  --campaign 25K=/results/25k/summary_aggregate.csv \
  --campaign 100K-even=/results/100k-even/summary_aggregate.csv \
  --campaign 25K-even=/results/25k-even/summary_aggregate.csv \
  --output-dir /results/trace-scale-comparison
```

It writes `trace-scale-comparison-data.csv` (the exact records plotted) and
turnaround/slowdown figures as PNG and PDF. No campaign path is built into the
script.

### Turnaround-estimation error

For a completed prediction-utilization study, replay the recorded placements
and compare each dispatch-time turnaround prediction with its realized
submit-to-completion time:

```bash
CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path/to/install \
python experimental/multi-cluster/analyze_turnaround_estimation.py
```

The script resolves the installed Python module beneath
`CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX`, using `CMAKE_INSTALL_LIBDIR` when it is exported and
otherwise checking both `lib` and `lib64`. By default it analyzes utilization
values 0.6, 0.7, 0.75, 0.8, 0.85, 0.9, 0.95, and 1.0 in
`prediction-utilization-study`. It writes
`turnaround-estimation-error.csv`, `.png`, and `.pdf` there. Use
`--study-dir`, `--systems`, `--utilizations`, or `--output-prefix` to override
those defaults.

MAPE and SMAPE are calculated per job. The CSV retains both the mean derived
from replayed per-job timestamps and the aggregate mean reported by the
original run. The script warns if those means differ, so an inconsistency is
not hidden by the summary plot.

## Output

Rank 0 writes one CSV row per successfully dispatched job; dropped jobs are
recorded in the log instead:

| Column | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `job_id` | Input identifier or generated zero-based row number. |
| `submit_time`, `num_nodes`, `duration`, `time_limit` | Original job-stream values. |
| `effective_nodes` | Submitted node count: `min(num_nodes, largest configured machine size)`. |
| `App`, `Args`, `Ranks` | Sampled workload identity. |
| `sys_requirement` | Application compatibility category. |
| `system_id` | Selected scheduler system. |
| `execution_mode` | Selected `CPU` or `GPU` implementation. |
| `ground_truth_relative_performance` | Selected mode's ground-truth speedup. |
| `predicted_relative_performance` | Selected mode's predicted speedup used for dispatch. |
| `prediction_fallback` | `true` when missing predictions caused Turnaround or RelPerfOnly to use wait-only placement for this job. |
| `estimated_wait` | Wait predicted from current worker state. |
| `estimated_duration` | Duration predicted for the dispatch decision. |
| `actual_duration` | Ground-truth duration submitted to DR_EVT. |
| `predicted_time_limit` | Wall-time limit used to estimate the dispatch candidate. |
| `actual_time_limit` | Ground-truth-scaled wall-time limit retained for comparison. |
| `submitted_time_limit` | Whole-second limit submitted to DR_EVT: the upward-rounded adapted predicted limit or ground-truth runtime, according to `--wall-time-policy`. |
| `time_limit_doublings` | Number of pre-submission doublings needed by the adapted predicted-limit policy; zero for `actual-duration`. |
| `predicted_turnaround` | `estimated_wait + estimated_duration`. |
| `job_idx` | Worker-local DR_EVT job identifier. |

After draining all workers, rank 0 prints submitted/completed counts and
makespan per system to standard error, followed by an `overall` line containing
these evaluation metrics:

| Metric | Definition |
|---|---|
| `average_turnaround_time` | Sum of actual submit-to-completion times divided by completed jobs. |
| `average_bounded_slowdown` | Mean of `max(1, turnaround / max(actual run time, 10 seconds))`. |
| `average_run_time` | Sum of ground-truth-scaled run times divided by dispatched jobs. |
| `average_speedup` | Sum of selected ground-truth workload speedups divided by dispatched jobs. |

Turnaround and bounded slowdown are weighted by each system's completed-job
count when combined. A mismatch between the completed and dispatched counts is
reported as an error rather than producing partial metrics. The Python/gRPC
implementation prints the same summary schema. The summary reports
`dropped_jobs` separately, and standard error contains one detailed record for
each dropped job.

## Python/gRPC implementation

`grpc_performance_dispatch.py` implements the same input model and online
dispatch policy through independent gRPC servers. The MPI launcher only starts
the controller and servers; the client script owns sampling and dispatch:

```bash
python3 python/grpc_mpi_launcher.py --mpi-ranks 6 \
  --server-binary build/dr_evt_server \
  --client-script experimental/multi-cluster/grpc_performance_dispatch.py -- \
  --jobs multi-cluster/job_stream.csv \
  --ground-truth experimental/multi-cluster/ground_truth.csv \
  --prediction experimental/multi-cluster/prediction.csv \
  --applications experimental/multi-cluster/apps.csv \
  --systems experimental/multi-cluster/machines.csv \
  --seed 7 \
  --max-time-limit 43200 \
  --dispatch-policy RelPerfOnly \
  --wall-time-policy adapted-limit \
  --output grpc-dispatch-decisions.csv
```

The same seed makes each implementation reproducible, but does not produce the
same sampled sequence across implementations because Python and C++ use
different random-number engines. Both implement uniform application sampling
followed by uniform workload sampling.

Run the Python policy tests directly:

```bash
source docs/venv/bin/activate
python3 experimental/multi-cluster/tests/test_performance_dispatch.py
```

The native dispatcher's end-to-end regression is registered separately with
CTest as `test_mpi_performance_dispatch`.

## Legacy platform-ranking baseline

```bash
python3 experimental/multi-cluster/tests/test_baseline_dispatch.py
```
